# SUSIE: Sustainable Societies Insight Engine

This repository contains code and resources for the SUSIE (Sustainable Societies Insight Engine) project, developed in collaboration with CPRAS.

## Overview

SUSIE is designed to extract, structure, and analyze climate action plan data from UK public sector organizations. The project supports automated, transparent, and data-driven assessment of climate strategies using modern NLP and decision analysis methods.

## Main Features

- **PDF to Text Conversion:** OCR-based extraction of text from policy documents
- **Data Cleaning & Standardization:** Scripts for preprocessing and structuring datasets
- **Multi-Dimensional Scoring:** LLM-based automated evaluation of climate projects
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Statistical and visual analysis of project datasets
- **Multi-Criteria Decision Analysis (MCDA):** Customized weighting and project ranking
- **Automated Recommendations & Visualization:** Generation of actionable insights and visual outputs
